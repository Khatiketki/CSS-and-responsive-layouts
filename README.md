Assignment 4: CSS and responsive layouts


Purpose: In this assignment, you will practice the CSS rules and instructions seen in class. You will have the opportunity to convert your work from previous assignments into a full-fledged, responsive website. By doing this without the help of any framework, you will be able to understand the underlying principles of how layouts work and how to tweak them to your will - which should be a great reference for any future work.

Task: The Vallejo Public Library has been very happy with your work: the sitemap and mockups look great, and they have authorized you to work on the actual website.

You have learned that the users of the library may use the website on all kinds of devices: from desktops to laptops to tablets and cellphones. You will need to make your designs a reality in a responsive way.

You will submit the URL of a GitHub repository that contains the following:

The same three HTML files you created for Assignment 2:
The homepage - this file must be called index.html,
The page that represents a book in the catalog,
Any other page of your choosing within the website.
CSS that implements the design that you created on Assignment 3. 
The design needs to be responsive, with at least three versions: for mobile devices, tablets, and full-size monitors.
The HTML pages must be linked to the CSS and the design must work in them. 
There must only be one CSS file for the two pages! Part of your assignment is to figure out the best way to do this.
The design must be based on the designs presented in Assignment 3.
Adjustments are OK. If done they must improve on the user experience. This will be judged and evaluated by the reviewer.
Any additional files (such as images, etc.) needed for your website to work.
Criteria and Examples: 

Your website should be based on the work you did for your previous assignments: the site map and the mockups. 
If needed, you can still make last-minute adaptations. I expect that, for example, the web pages will mostly, but not exactly, look like the mockup. This can happen because you need to update the design to make it responsive, for example.
You need to still follow the requirements for the website given in previous assignments:
Pages must contain a header, body, and footer, and the navigations you proposed.
Any forms to search books must be available. (It does not need to work, but it must be there.)
HTML must be semantic.
The text must be readable by children and adults ranging from 6 to 90 years of age.
The homepage must contain a section for the latest news.
The book page must contain: information about the book, how many copies the library owns and how many of those are available, and include a way to start the book reservation process. 
Your website must work as-is. To evaluate your website, I will:
Download your repo into my computer,
Open the homepage at "index.html",
Open the other pages using the navigation,
Resize the browser and, possibly, use a touch screen to evaluate how the website works for mobile devices.
Test your files well. I expect this assignment to be done with professional quality. This means:
No misspellings.
Navigation and other links must work; links must not be broken (for example, because they start with a "/", or because the file name has uppercase letters or spaces). I highly recommend that the filenames are one single word in lowercase (for example: "book.html" or "catalog.html").
The website must work well on all screens. Things must not get on top of other things; images must not become weirdly stretched, and so on.
I will discount points for these mistakes.
Note that you can present as many HTML pages as you want. I will review all pages you present and any error on any page will count. Whatever you present, test it well. 
You MUST have permission to use any resources used in your website. This includes text, images, fonts, etc. 
Do not copy and paste text from other websites. Write your text. (You may use software to improve the quality of the text, but do not ask AI to generate it for you.)
I recommend using Google Fonts for fonts.
For images, you may use sites such as Unsplash (https://unsplash.com/Links to an external site.), Pexels (https://www.pexels.com/Links to an external site.) or similar. If the terms of service of the images ask you to give credit, you must give credit. You may use space in your website footer to add the required text.
IMPORTANT: RESOURCES USED WITHOUT PERMISSION CAN BE INTERPRETED AS PLAGIARISM. Again: you MUST give credit.
